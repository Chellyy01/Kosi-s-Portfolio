        </div>
        <div class="problem">
            <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
            <p>How might we understand and design to scaffold the patient experience of accessing mental health records to empower patients, and foster trust?</p>

            <p>  Accessing mental health records isn’t just about clicking a button. It’s about opening a deeply personal chapter of a patient’s life. Inside those records are diagnoses, reflections, moments of clarity and moments of struggle. Yet in Ireland, accessing mental health records is burdened with delays, and bureaucracy. Mental health records hold the power to inform, to validate, and to heal. But when handled poorly, they can also create distress, and mistrust in the very systems meant to support patients.</p>

            <p> In Ireland, patients are left to spiral in silence, struggling with fear, shame, and isolation, while their mental health records sit behind locked doors. They wait weeks, months, even years for access, unsure what has been written about them or by whom. Their pain is buried, their agency stripped away.</p>

            <p>  This design challenge was researched and designed by myself and four other fantastic designers in the person of; Nikhil Afonso
              Shivangi Bodh, Swetha Vukkadala, Yujing Liang. We partnered with Lia Foley - Kelleher, a product designer and patient advocate from The National College of Art and Design (NCAD) in Ireland. She is passionate about mental health and environmental issues, and is guided by  human - centred design philosophy.</p>

        <div class="literature">
            <h1>Literature Review and Research Foundations</h1>
            <p>To design emotionally intelligent systems, we first needed to understand what had been done, what worked, and where gaps remain. Conducting a literature review allowed us to critically examine past research, avoid duplication, and build on proven insights. This process grounded our work in evidence while ensuring our design approach was empathetic and inclusive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="competitive">
            <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
            <p>We also explored how other countries approach digital mental health access. Our competitive analysis included Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Iceland, the UK, and the USA. Each provided valuable perspectives on how digital tools support (or fail to support) users in accessing mental health care.</p>

        <div class="expert">
            <h1>Expert & Public Insights</h1>
            <p>To complement this, we interviewed two mental health professionals and conducted public surveys to uncover pain points. A key finding was that 66.7% of respondents in Ireland reported difficulty accessing their mental health records.</p>

            <p>  Through thematic analysis of interviews, several recurring themes emerged:</p>

            <p> - Psychiatric records are complex and not easily understandable for patients.<br>
              - Emotional readiness should be considered before granting access.<br>
              - The access experience varies widely between patients.<br>
              - AI and digital tools show potential to improve access but raise ethical concerns.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="user">
            <h1>User Journey Mapping</h1>
            <p>From these insights, we created a User Journey Map that visualized the emotional challenges users face when accessing their mental health records in Ireland. This allowed us to empathize with users and highlight opportunities for intervention.</p>
            <div>
                <img class="user-img1" src="images/Group 5889.svg" alt="">
                <img class="user-img2" src="images/Group 5888.svg" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="backcasting">
            <h1>Backcasting & Ideation</h1>
            <p>We used backcasting to imagine the ideal end result an accessible, emotionally supportive mental health record system and worked backwards to define the necessary steps to achieve it.</p>

            <p>During ideation, each team member generated three initial concepts.  We went for a mobile application because of reasons such as: From the  distributed survey to the general public, the results showed that most respondents prefer to access and manage their mental health records through an online platform, In our interviews, experts also emphasised the value of an online platforms, noting that an easy-to-use portal should be provided, along with emotional support and reflective guidance features and finally, The convenience of mobile app, users can access mental health records anytime and anywhere. We then refined and prioritized these ideas through a co-design workshop with partners, using structured frameworks such as MoSCoW prioritization and “How Might We” questions.</p>
            <div>
                <img class="back-img1" src="images/Group 5890.svg" alt="">
                <img class="back-img2" src="images/Group 5894.svg" alt="">
                <img class="back-img3" src="images/Group 5901.svg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p class="second">This process helped us to define actionable design directions that were deeply grounded in user needs, expert insights, and ethical considerations and guiding us toward creating a more emotionally intelligent and inclusive digital mental health system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wireframing">
            <h1>Wireframing and Userflow</h1>
            <p>We started with wireframing which  are the outcome of extensive research, followed by ideation and supported by two key workshops: Task Flow Analysis and Dot Voting. These helped us validate user journeys and prioritize emotionally meaningful features. We chose to design an app based on accessibility needs, user preferences, and mobile-first insights from our research.</p>

            <p>This stage reflects the combined impact of our insights, ideation, and design decisions. Building on this strong foundation, we created interactive wireframes and iterated based on our team's discussions but before moving to high-fidelity design, we plan to conduct usability testing and make further refinements based on stakeholder feedback. Below are some of the screens along side their userflow.</p>
            <div>
                <img class="wire-img1" src="images/Group 5907.svg" alt="">
                <img class="wire-img2" src="images/Group 5910.svg" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="screen">
            <h1>Some Screens of the  UI Design</h1>
            <div>
                <img class="screen-img1" src="images/Group 5913.svg" alt="">
                <img class="screen-img2" src="images/Group 5914.svg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>We did usability testing to check how well our high-fidelity prototype worked in a realistic setting and to find possible user experience problems. We also asked our partner, Lia Foley-Kelleher, to do an expert review of the product. Before creating the high-fidelity designs, we tested low-fidelity versions and improved them based on feedback.</p>

            <p>From the start, we focused on accessibility because health information should be easy to use for everyone, especially older adults, people with low digital skills, and people with vision problems. Using the Stark plugin in Figma, we tested our original high-fidelity screens in different conditions, such as low contrast, color blindness (Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, Achromatopsia), and bright light glare.</p>

            <p>These tests showed issues like a “Track” button with low contrast, which was hard to see in some cases. While most of the design already met WCAG contrast standards, the tests helped us spot small but important problems. Fixing them early made the design more inclusive, reliable, and supportive for all users.</p>
