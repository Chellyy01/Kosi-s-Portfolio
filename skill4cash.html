              Skill4Cash is a platform that helps service providers find customers, with ease. It also simultaneously helps customers find solutions to 
              their service needs, seamlessly. Think of Skill4Cash as the Toptal for all services.</p>
            <p>
              This project was birthed by the need of service providers who find it difficult to get customers or people who find it difficult to find 
              service providers around them.</p>
            <p>

        <div class="why">
          <h1>Why Skill4Cash</h1>
          <p>According to the research, 60 percent of service providers do not have adequate customers they need to keep their business stable, 
            and 50 percent of people (customers) do not have access to the services they need at a particular time.
          </p>  
          <p>This is usually as a result of service providers not being at a location where their customers can easily find them.
          </p>  
          <p>Many Service Providers in Nigeria are unevenly distributed across the country, making it difficult for them to easily find customers. 
            Customers on their end, have no way of reaching out and engaging the services of these service providers. Most of these service 
            providers also lack the spending power to properly advertise themselves and acquire physical stores in the eyebrow locations where they 
            can meet potential customers.
          </p>  
          <p>Amazingly, since the world has become mostly digital, most interactions have been primarily online, and many businesses are positioning 
            themselves to be a part of the evolution. They however still face certain challenges including the high cost of hiring developers to build 
            solutions for their businesses.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="market">
          <h1>Market Research</h1>
          <p>To get things started, we sought out skilled individuals and service providers to find out about how they currently get their customers and the challenges 
            they may have. We also talked to a few individuals to ascertain how they currently source for service providers for their regular needs.</p>
            
          <p> We discovered the following:</p>
          <p>  
            - A lot of service providers are unable to properly advertise their services leading to a lack of exposure to the right clientele.<br>
            - Individuals in need of services are skeptical about engaging in an online option.<br>
            - There is an inability to properly connect with prospects.<br>
            - Unconvincing online presence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="solu">
          <h1>Solution</h1>
          <p>To solve the problem for these service providers and individuals, we looked closely at existing digital solutions and came up with solutions that simply build 
            on the foundation they have laid.</p>
            
          <p> We came up with these: </p>
            
          <p>- A seamless and simple-to-navigate cross-platform mobile app, so the reach is limitless.<br>
            - Service provider and Users ratings and reviews, to give assurance to both parties.<br>
            - An in-app messaging and scheduler that enables interaction and setting of service appointments at a time 
               convenient for both parties.<br>
            - A proper verification process for service providers.<br>
            - In-app gallery, so service providers can display recent photos of completed works.</p>
            
          <p class="red">After the lunch, we measured the appâ€™s success through key metrics like; User engagement, Satisfaction, performance and Data security. 
            The results are:</p>
