        <p>Kona mobile application is an application that allows one to transfer their local currency anywhere in the world and in turn the person on the other side will receive the money in their currency too. That is to say that a Nigerian can transfer naira (NGN) to someone in the United States and the person will receive it in dollars (USDT).</p>

        <h1>Why Kona</h1>
        <p>In Nigeria, Large population of people gain admission abroad year in year out but find it difficult to pay for their tuition fee because they do 
            not have a domiciliary account that will enable them to pay for their fees in the country's local currency. Also, a parent cannot transfer/
            receive money from/to their children/child abroad without the domiciliary account. This is a great problem as parents/students and even 
            workers always get frustrated while opening the domiciliary account because some banks have rules and processes to observe the 
            domiciliary account can be created. This may cause them not to beat the deadline and some end up not registering or even losing the 
            admission in the long run.
        </p>
        <p>Kona mobile application will solve the problem because with the application you can transfer and receive money anywhere in the world 
            without having to open a specific account for it. That is to say, you can transfer money with your local currency and another person 
            abroad will receive it in their local currency too.

        <p>My target audience in this research are adults, both male and female, employed and unemployed, students, business/entrepreneur, so 
            far as you send and receive money.

        <h1>Market Research</h1>
        <p>This research sets out to explore the challenges that students, parents, professionals, and adults in general encounter when carrying out international 
            transactions and to seek possible solutions to ease those challenges.
        </p>
        <p>From my findings, I discovered:</p>
        <p>-Many people today can complete cross-border transactions with relative ease.<br>
            - However, a significant number, especially students, experience frustration, largely because most transactions require either a domiciliary account or 
            reliance on money transfer services such as Western Union.<br>
            - Unfortunately, both options often present hurdles: opening a domiciliary account can be a lengthy, bureaucratic process, while accessing Western 
            Union or similar services isnâ€™t always convenient or straightforward.</p>

            Nigerians, access is restricted by location. As a result, the store links are not accessible in Ireland or other European countries.</p>
