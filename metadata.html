        <p>In today's world, having the right kind of knowledge is so important, but more so data, which is the root of so much of what we call 
          knowledge. Data is one of the most valuable assets an individual, a business, nation and the world at large, can have. It is the bedrock of 
          our basic needs, it helps in making informed decisions, it enables key strategic initiatives and with the rise of software, the utilization of 
          data is immense. As its demand increases, so does data. That’s why it’s vital to utilize the right tools and technologies to fully leverage all 
          available data and make it as accurate as possible. Low-quality data adversely impacts performance in the area of need which is why 
          ensuring data quality should be a top priority for all.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="what">
        <h1>What is Metadata</h1>
        <p>Good data quality starts with metadata. Metadata answers the who, what, when, where, why, and how questions for users of the data. 
          It characterizes data and provides documentation such that the data can be understood and more readily consumed by users. Metadata 
          is required to place the data into proper categories for determining the controls that are needed to assure quality and to determine 
          which regulations apply to the data.</p>

          - To store uploaded files for users so that they can come back to them at any given time.<br>
          - To allow users to share or download their metadata for other ethical purposes. <br>
          - To give users an appealing application that is comfortable to use.</p>

      <div class="feature">
        <h1>Features in the web application</h1>
        <p>-Login: Users are required to create an account and to login before they use the system so as to make sure we know who is uploading 
          what to prevent misuse of the system for illegal purposes.<br>
          - File Upload: Users can upload files in the format of pdf, txt, csv, json, jpg, jpeg.<br>
          - Login.<br>
          -Generate Metadata: Metadata of the uploaded file is immediately provided to the user once it is uploaded without having the user to 
          click on any other button or link to have good user experience.<br>
          - Account Settings: Users can view, edit their passwords.<br>
          - Manage Uploaded Files: Users can view and save files and/or metadata of the files they have uploaded before so that they can use 
          the information again.</p>
          
        <p class="red">After the lunch, we measured the app’s success through key metrics like; User engagement, Satisfaction, performance and Data 
          security. The results are:</p>
