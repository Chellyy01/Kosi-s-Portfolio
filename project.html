              Skill4Cash is a platform that helps service providers find customers, with ease. It also simultaneously helps customers find solutions to 
  their service needs, seamlessly. Think of Skill4Cash as the Toptal for all services.</p>
  <p>
  This project was birthed by the need of service providers who find it difficult to get customers or people who find it difficult to find 
  service providers around them.</p>
  <p>
  Designed by a team of 3 superb designers: Oso Paul, Wale Ogunsusi & I.</p>

        <div class="why">
          <h1>Why Skill4Cash</h1>
          <p>According to the research, 60 percent of service providers do not have adequate customers they need to keep their business stable, 
            and 50 percent of people (customers) do not have access to the services they need at a particular time.
          </p>  
          <p>This is usually as a result of service providers not being at a location where their customers can easily find them.
          </p>  
          <p>Many Service Providers in Nigeria are unevenly distributed across the country, making it difficult for them to easily find customers. 
            Customers on their end, have no way of reaching out and engaging the services of these service providers. Most of these service 
            providers also lack the spending power to properly advertise themselves and acquire physical stores in the eyebrow locations where they 
            can meet potential customers.
          </p>  
          <p>Amazingly, since the world has become mostly digital, most interactions have been primarily online, and many businesses are positioning 
            themselves to be a part of the evolution. They however still face certain challenges including the high cost of hiring developers to build 
            solutions for their businesses.</p>
